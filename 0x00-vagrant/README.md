*Command Uname*

### First command that I write in linux

the command uname print name of the machine that actually you're using"

```

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/holbertonschool-zero_day/0x00-vagrant$ uname
Linux
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/holbertonschool-zero_day/0x00-vagrant$

```

> * Linux is the best Operating System I like a lot.
